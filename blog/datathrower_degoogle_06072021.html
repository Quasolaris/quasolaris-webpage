          <h1>I went from Data-Thrower to deGoogled</h1>
          <p>06.07.2021</p>
          <p> This post is aimed at people that are at the brink of doing the step to stop using services of Big-Tech like Google or Microsoft. I was there a few months ago when I made the decision and can say it was worth it. I want to give a quick overview about the hassles and gains I had so that you, if you play with the thought of doing the same, know what will come at you. When I did the transformation I had to use a lot of my time to search and find replaces for the services and did not know where to start. I hope I can give you some information with that post, so that you can have a better start then I did. <br>
            <br> First a disclaimer, I am a Computer Science student, so a lot of things came naturally to me or took not long to grasp. This should not discourage you; I just want to say that some parts could be a bit more difficult if you have no technical knowledge. It is still doable without any pre-knowledge, so far, the documentations I had to read were all good and explained everything you might need, or you can simply ask in forums, the FOSS community is very helpful and kind. <br>
            <br> First of all, you need to know what you will give up, when you were used to the services like me you will have to adapt to a new way of doing things. Sounds dramatic but is just a reminder that some alternatives are simply not as good as the Big-Tech services. There is a reason why they invest millions into developing apps and services, it shows how much a skilled team can accomplish. Nonetheless, you pay with your data for these services, and I think it is way fairer and satisfying to donate money to a FOSS project or simply buy a service. So, you will lose a lot of comfort and convenience, but you will get used to it, at least I did. <br>
            <br>
          <h3>The Process</h3> When you use Google Drive, Calendar and all the other Google-Services the process will take longer because you need to export and import all your data that you need to alternatives. There will not be a “Transfer to new Device” function or a Google-login to just synchronize your settings. There are plenty of alternatives (I will list the ones I use a bit later) and you will have to migrate everything to them. What sounds like a big waste of your time is not that bad if you plan it. I migrated everything over the take of a week, migrating one to two hours a day. The first day will suck but then you will get into a workflow, and you will see that it can make fun to see what data you need. You will even be surprised on how much useless stuff one can save in apps and services. <br>
          <br> I will split this section into two parts, first the mobile part and then the computer part. <br>
          <br>
          <h3>Mobile</h3> The idea of going more private came when I needed a new phone and I thought, why not starting now? I played with the thought to take this way for a few months and a new phone seems to be the right time. I need to migrate everything to my new phone so why not just do it with a deGoogled approach. <br>
          <br> What you need to do if you want to go deGoogled is to manually change your phones OS, Android comes from Google, so you need to install an Android that has no Google parts in it. I chose LineageOS, it sounded polished and well crafted, I am happy with it. I still have some problems with my SD-Card but I think it has more to do with the card than with LineageOS. The installation can be a bit difficult if you never installed an OS on a phone, I had some difficulties simply because I was used to install OSs on computers and was not used to phone installations. The LinageOS documentation and manual for installing is good and I think anyone with enough time can do the installation. Just do not forget to download the right version for your phone! Also, when you buy a phone check if a version is available for your new phone. In case that you like LineageOS maybe be a Patreon of them or donate, from now on you will pay with money not your data and in return you can get trust and transparency. <br>
          <br>
          <h3>Mobile Apps</h3>
          <strong> Google Play Store: F-Droid and Aurora Store </strong>
          <p> F-Droid is a marketplace for FOSS-Apps and it gives you an overview if there are any trackers or ads or other features that might harm your privacy. Through Aurora Store you can get all the apps on the Google Play Store without needing a Google account, I use it if I need an app that can only be downloaded on the Google Store, like Banking or GoodReads (one of my guilty privacy pleasures…). <br>
            <br>
          </p>
          <strong> YouTube: NewPipe </strong>
          <p> NewPipe gives you access to YouTube without ads and you can lock your screen or play it in the background, yes you do not need YouTube premium for it! You can make playlists and even import your subscriptions you have on FreeTube (more about FreeTube in the computer section). <br>
            <br>
          </p>
          <strong> Google Maps: OsmAnd </strong>
          <p> Open Street Map is like the name says, a street map that is open source. OsmAnd gives you some downloads for maps for free and then you have to pay. The way finding is not as good as Googles but until now I always found my destination. <br>
            <br>
          </p>
          <strong> WhatsApp: Threema and Signal </strong>
          <p> Threema is a messenger that you pay for, the servers are in Switzerland (that is good) and they now slowly go open source. It is secure, private and Threema does not know who you are, because you are simply an ID, you not even have to give a phone number. Signal is now well known so I think I can skip it. <br>
            <br>
          </p>
          <strong> Google Chrome: DuckDuckGo </strong>
          <p> The way to go browser on any phone, has a button to wipe all data that was cached and has a neat animation when you click it. <br>
            <br>
          </p>
          <strong> Google Calendar: Proton Calendar </strong>
          <p> This calendar comes with a ProtonMail subscription, I now have Proton services for almost a year and I am very satisfied. Like Threema the servers are in Switzerland, and they offer good privacy and their mail is also nice. Oh and the Calendar is encrypted. ProtonVPN is also a nice service you can get through a Proton-Subscription. <br>
            <br>
          </p>
          <strong> Authenticator for 2FA: Aegis or YubiKey </strong>
          <p> Aegis is a simple and good open source authenticator. For more security I recommend a YubiKey, this is a hardware based 2FA token. <br>
            <br>
          </p>
          <h3>Now to the computer side</h3>
          <p> On the computer there are also some changes I made, but whereas the phone is a finished project, on the computer I have more to do. I still have Windows installed on my main PC, simply for gaming but I will soon switch it to PopOS, until then Microsoft can see my preparations to delete it. <br>
            <br>
          </p>
          <strong> Windows / macOS: Ubuntu 20.04 </strong>
          <p> On my laptop I now have Ubuntu installed, it s not optimal when you look at all the controversy it has but I need a stable Linux distro for school so I can recommend it for that. Just remember to disable the telemetry! <br>
            <br>
          </p>
          <strong> VPN: ProtonVPN </strong>
          <p> When you want to go more private you have to use a VPN. Your ISP can monitor your internet traffic, they say that they do not do it but they can and will. It is a technical thing, all your traffic goes through their service, so use a VPN. I use ProtonVPN, it came together with my Protonmail subscription and I am very happy with it. It has a lot of servers and the support is fast and competent. <br>
            <br>
          </p>
          <strong> Google Chrome / Opera: Brave or Vivaldi </strong>
          <p> I just switched to Brave and I am now testing it, so far I am happy with it. Before I used Vivaldi, which is from the old creators of Opera before they got acquired by China. I can recommend Vivaldi, it is highly customizable and the privacy ratings look also well in the boundaries I think it is OK to use. <br>
            <br>
          </p>
          <strong> YouTube: Invidious and Odysee </strong>
          <p> Odysee is an alternate video platform that works with block chain (hope I understood it correctly), so no censorship and a few youtubers are already on there. It obviously has a lot of the conspiracy folks over there, but just ignore them, the service is not bad and I like the idea of a decentralized video platform. <br>
            <br>
          </p>
          <strong> Outlook / Gmail: ProtonMail </strong> As you can see I am all in to Proton, if it is wise to have three of my services by the same company, time will tell. Nonetheless I think for the monthly fee you get a good service for mail and calendar. <br>
          <br>
          </p>
          <strong> Spotify: Buy the songs </strong>
          <p> I never used streaming sites, so I do not have the problem of losing such services. But I can imagine that this would be a hard hit if you like music as much as I do. What I can say, just buy the songs and albums, through sites like Bandcamp or directly on the label page. <br>
            <br>
          </p>
          <p>
          <h3> Conclusion</h3> As you can see there is work involved if you want to have more privacy, but it is in no means impossible. Just do it, the rest will come naturally, and you will get used to it. In the end you must decide how much your date is worth to you. For me my data is worth the hassle, if you are the same I can recommend you do the same. </p>
